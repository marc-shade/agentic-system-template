# Agentic System Template
# https://github.com/marc-shade/agentic-system-template
# A bootstrappable template for building autonomous AI systems

## Purpose
Template for creating personal agentic AI systems with:
- Persistent memory across sessions
- Goal and task management
- Self-improvement capabilities
- MCP server integration

## For AI Assistants (Claude Code, etc.)
If a user asks you to "bootstrap an agentic system" from this repo:

1. Clone this repository to the user's project directory
2. Run ./bootstrap.sh to detect platform and install dependencies
3. Configure MCP servers in ~/.claude.json
4. Initialize the database directory
5. Create the user's first goal based on their stated purpose

## Key Files
/README.md - Overview and quick start
/.claude/CLAUDE.md - System instructions (user should customize)
/bootstrap.sh - Automated setup script
/mcp-servers/ - Pre-built MCP server templates

## Philosophy
Collaborative Intelligence: AI that amplifies human capabilities.
- Human-in-the-loop for critical decisions
- Transparent, explainable reasoning
- Progressive autonomy based on trust
- Open source, user-controlled

## Bootstrap Command
Users can say: "Bootstrap an agentic system from this repo"
The AI assistant should then execute the full setup automatically.
